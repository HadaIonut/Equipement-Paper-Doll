Equipment Paper Doll is a module that offers an immersive interface for equipping items on your actors.

All actors have an individual interface where they can equip items present in their inventories.

Note: Equipping items here does not have an actual effect, it is just a visual tool for what items go where on your
actor's body.

For convenience each body part has a list of items that matches some filters specific for that part.

If you want to equip an item that does not match the filter you can always see all items in the inventory.

## Settings
### Global settings

From the module settings tab you can configure the keywords that each body part filters by, and the number of items that
can be equipped on each body part

## Individual settings

As a game master you can configure the number of items that can be equipped on each body part for each actor. If no
changes are made on an actor then the global settings are used.

Additionally, you can also change the background image. I would recommend an image where the character is centered, and
it's background is transparent.
